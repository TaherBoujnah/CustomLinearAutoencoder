# CustomLinearAutoencoder

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a custom Linear Layer (`MeinLayer`) and its application in building a simple autoencoder. The implementation demonstrates the creation of custom neural network layers and their integration into an Encoder-Decoder architecture.

## Features

- Custom linear layer (`MeinLayer`) implemented using PyTorch.
- Encoder and Decoder models built with the custom layer.
- Autoencoder workflow: encoding and reconstructing input data.
- Fully tested functionality for learning and experimentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.9+

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install torch
